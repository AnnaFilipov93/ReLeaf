## _ReLeaf - web application_

The app identifies flowers and leaves diseases.

In the process, a deep CNN network model is trained, resNet50,  to recognize 7 flowers (daisy, sunflower, dandelion, rose, tulip, iris, and water lily) and 4 leaf diseases (healthy, dryness, magnesium lack, and bug holes) from datasets that Iâ€™ve collected.

YOLO v3 is used to detect the objects to separate between flowers and the leaves before sending each of the images to the corresponding model.
